        <h3>Other ways to get involved</h3>
         <p>
        AMC Theatres (AMC) and the Autism Society have teamed up to bring families affected by autism and other disabilities a special opportunity to enjoy their favorite films in a safe and accepting environment on a monthly basis with the “Sensory Friendly Films” program. In order to provide a more comfortable setting for this unique audience, the movie auditoriums will have their lights brought up and the sound turned down, families will be able to bring in their own gluten-free, casein-free snacks, and no previews or advertisements will be shown before the movie. Additionally, audience members are welcome to get up and dance, walk, shout or sing – in other words, AMC’s “Silence is Golden®” policy will not be enforced unless the safety of the audience is questioned.

        <h3>Get involved </h3>
         <p>
            There are many ways to get involved in the autism community. The Autism Society encourages its members and supporters to keep current on and active in ongoing advocacy issues regarding autism, stay abreast of the latest in autism-related news and issues through our online newsletter, Autism Matters, and make an effort to attend autism events and conferences in your area. The benefits of being involved in the autism community are many—not the least of which is educating yourself about the most appropriate treatments and resources available to help your loved one on the spectrum.

        <h3>Educate Yourself</h3>
         <p>
            The Autism Society works to influence public policy, with an emphasis on Education, Medicaid, and Employment –issues which are all vital to individuals with autism and their families. Through our Governmental Affairs staff, we represent you at the White House and executive branches such as the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education and Department of Labor as well as many others. The Autism Society relies upon a proactive approach to advocacy by working alongside policy makers, elected officials and their staff to advance the wellbeing of all living with autism. We often times work in collaboration with national disability rights organizations, so we have a stronger voice on Capitol Hill.
            At the state and local levels, Autism Society affiliates advocate for individuals and families impacted by autism in communities across the nation. Each year, volunteers and staff from around the United States come to Washington, D.C. to meet with their national elected officials and to promote a legislative agenda that improves the quality of life of each individual diagnosed with autism.
