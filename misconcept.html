		<h1>Misconceptions of Autism</h1>

		<div id="misconcept-block-container">
			
			<div class="block">
				<div>
					<div>Is Caused By Vaccine</div>
					<p class="hidden">There is no evidence that childhood vaccination causes autism. A 1998 study linking autism with vaccines has since been retracted.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="block"> 
				<div>
					<div>Is A Mental Disorder</div>
					<p class="hidden">Individuals on the autism spectrum are unique, with a wide range of intellectual abilities that easily can be under- or over-estimated. Tests designed to include language and interpersonal analyses may misrepresent the intelligence of people with autism, who struggle with social skills, and individuals with autism may have difficulty with tasks considered simple, but quickly master complex tasks and concepts. Individuals on the autism spectrum have also earned college and graduate degrees and work in a variety of professions. Conversely, it may be assumed that an individual with autism has a higher level of understanding than they do, based on their behavior, language skills or high-level of ability in a specific area.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="block">
				<div>
					<div>Is Caused By Bad Parenting</div>
					<p class="hidden">In the 1950s, there was an assumption that autism was caused by emotionally distant or cold parents. Though the exact cause of autism has not been determined, it is now firmly established that autism has nothing to do with parenting.</p>
